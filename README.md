**Project Objective :-**

This project aims to build a dynamic, real-time dashboard in Power BI that connects to an SQL database. The dashboard visualizes key insights such as sales performance, regional analysis, and targets using the Adventure Works dataset. The project integrates data processing using Python, data storage in MySQL, and real-time data updates in Power BI.

**Project Structure :-**

This project follows a structured approach with the following key steps:

**Data Processing :-**

Load and clean the Adventure Works dataset using Python and pandas.
Handle missing data, normalize formats, and ensure data consistency.

**SQL Database Setup :-**

Create a MySQL database with appropriate tables for each dataset (Product, Sales, Region, etc.).
Load cleaned data into the MySQL tables.

**Power BI Dashboard :-**

Connect Power BI to the MySQL database.
Design an interactive dashboard that reflects key sales metrics and real-time updates.

**Real-Time Data Updates :-**

Configure Power BI to automatically refresh data at intervals or trigger updates based on SQL changes.
